Log into the OsTicket browser and make sure you are on the "admin panel" (reference picture # 1). Click "agents" then "roles". Next click "add new role" to create a "super admin" whom can do every task since he/she will have all permissions and access. This process will need to be repeated to perform the next two steps which are: configuring the departments & teams (create "System Administrators department" & "level II Support team"). Please reference screenshots above.

Create two test agents ("John Doe" and "Jane Doe"). Assign John to "System Administrators" department with "Super administrator" permission level & added her to Level II support team, all of these options are located under the access & Teams tabs on the same agent screen. Next add "Jane Doe" the same way as previously completed for John. Please reference pictures above in order.
