After logging into the OsTicket browser, make sure you are on the "admin panel" and not the "agent panel". Click "agents" then "roles". Next click "add new role" to create a "super admin" whom can do every task since he/she will have all permissions and access. This process wiil need to be repeated to perform the next two steps which are configuring the departments & teams(create "System Administrators department" & "level II Support team").
